The struggle of separating the files is real which file is the original and which one is duplicate???

The storage sometimes ends up with a lot of duplicate data which is unnecessary :( Buying new storage can be costly :(

Our Aim through this project is to manage duplicate files from original files and to locate and delete these files. :)

And also to find differences in the files and folders. As well as to encrypt and decrypt files safely with passwords.

Cryptographically sign documents along with assisting transferring documents easily.
